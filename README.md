## Description
The Social Network API is the back-end for a social media site that allows users to create accounts with emails and usernames, post thoughts, add reations to thoughts, and add other users as friends. The Social Network API makes extensive use of MongoDB due its speed with large quantities of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## Installation
To install the E-Commerce Back End, download [the repository](https://github.com/mshaari/social-network-api) from GitHub by running
```
git clone git@github.com:mshaari/social-network-api.git
```
in your command line and open in Visual Studio Code. To install all dependencies, run
 
```
npm install
```

## Usage
To invoke the Employee Tracker, open 'server.js' in an integrated terminal and run the following two commands (you may skip the first if you do not wish to seed the database with sample data):
```
npm run seed

npm run start
``` 
To actually interact with the Social Network API, you can use Insomnia, as demonstrated in the upcoming video.
